            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I caught covid recently. After feeling symptoms, I took at at-home test, which confirmed that I had the disease. I immediately started the <a href="https://covid19criticalcare.com/covid-19-protocols/i-mask-plus-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FLCCC.net I-MASK+ protocol for early treatment</a>. I had planned ahead and had all the supplements, including doctor-prescribed Ivermectin, on-hand. My symptoms subsided after three days.</p><p>I have personally witnessed <strong>eight</strong> other people recover in similarly record time, using Ivermectin. There is so much propaganda that is confusing and scaring people, which is leading to suffering and death. The reason I've written this blog post is because I feel its important for people share their stories. There is a growing chorus of people who are ignoring the 'experts' and focusing instead on what is <em>actually</em> effective. That is the basis for FLCCC: doctors on the front lines of ICUs, discovering and using medications that are actually effective. No propaganda. No carefully-controlled lab-studies that fall apart in the real world.</p><p>Here is a breakdown of the other people that I have witnessed recover from Covid, using Ivermectin:</p><ul><li><p>A friend of the family was at a biker convention in mid-2020. He and three friends got covid, and two of the four had developed pneumonia. They had no access to doctor-prescribed Ivermectin, so they ate the horse-paste out of desperation. They all recovered within a few days.<br><br></p></li><li><p>My father caught covid in late 2020. He had doctor-prescribed Ivermectin on-hand and immediately started on the I-MASK+ protocol. He was 65 and was eligible for monoclonal antibodies. He recovered in three days.<br><br></p></li><li><p>My friend and his wife in Venezuela caught covid. They suffered for two weeks before they were able to obtain Ivermectin. After taking it, they recovered in four days.<br><br></p></li><li><p>A friend I was with caught covid at the same time I did. He took the exact same regimine of suppliments I did, and he recovered in the same amount of time.</p></li></ul><p>Any one of these cases could be considered a coincidence in isolation. But there is a very clear pattern: Ivermectin is an effective treatment against covid.</p><p>Doctor-prescribed ivermectin is not easy to get. Doctors are being persecuted, as well as pharmacies. Even if you can find a doctor to prescribe it, there is no guarantee you'll be able to find a pharmacy to fulfill it. FLCCC has a page to help people figure out <a href="https://covid19criticalcare.com/pharmacies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to get Ivermectin</a>.</p><p>The government and pharmaceutical companies have mishandled the pandemic every step of the way. The only person that is going to save you, is you. Covid is an incredibly manageable disease. Early treatment is critical. Make your own health choices. Take control of you own health. Share you story with others. And if possible, try to obtain enough Ivermectin for yourself, plus a little extra to share with those you care about.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The previous blog post provided a very high-level overview of the <a href="/blog/web3-cashstack">Web 3 Cash Stack architecture</a>. This article descends into various implementations of that architecture that I, and other decentralized members of <a href="https://psfoundation.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the PSF</a>, are in the process of standing up.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Implementing the Web 3.0 Cash Stack" src="/assets/images/web3-realized-dd53caae8e5bef1755910a3001f8ec4f.png" width="1343" height="903" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>If the images appear too small to read the text, click on them to open a larger version of the image.</p><p>While it looks lot busier, the image above has all all the same features as the simplified Web 3 diagram in the previous blog post. It's easier to describe how all the pieces fit together by walking through the three main layers of infrastructure:</p><ul><li>Global Back End Software</li><li>Local Back End Software</li><li>Front End Software</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="global-back-end">Global Back End<a class="hash-link" href="#global-back-end" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The global back end is the part of the software stack that has changed the least. While the original <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/cash-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cash Stack</a> has had steady improvements, it's basic architecture has changed very little in the last three years. What <em>has</em> changed is the emphasis on software further up the stack that interfaces with it, and putting the <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-service-provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON RPC over IPFS</a> on equal footing with the conventional REST API.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Global Back End Software" src="/assets/images/web3-realized-global-backend-fa30c4abf40cecfd126b9e06e994655e.png" width="1343" height="563" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Whereas the focus has been on <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bch-api</a> in the past, there is a new focus on the <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-bch-wallet-service</a> as the primary way to interface with the back end infrastructure. <code>bch-api</code>, our Web 2.0 workhorse, isn't going anywhere. It's flexible and high-resolution REST API interface will always be preferred for Web 2.0 companies and exchanges. <code>ipfs-bch-wallet-service</code> compliements <code>bch-api</code> by <a href="https://ipfs-bch-wallet-service.fullstack.cash/#api-JSON_BCH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simplifying the API</a> to a few endpoints that are needed for common wallet use cases. It also provides this API over two interfaces:</p><ul><li>REST API over HTTP</li><li>JSON RPC over IPFS</li></ul><p>The JSON RPC over IPFS is what unlocks the real power of web3. Because IPFS automatically handles the networking and easily penetrates firewalls, the global back end software can use consumer hard drives, in normal desktop computers, using home internet connections. This directly competes with the cloud infrastructure needed by Web 2.0 apps, and drastically lowers costs. It also makes it easier for web3 community members to support one another, and improves decentralization.</p><p>In the image, two PSF servers are called out by their <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-coord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-coord</a> names:</p><ul><li>bch-wallet-service-US-PDX</li><li>bch-wallet-service-west-coast-canada</li></ul><p>There are more than these two servers on the network, and more will be added in the future thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bounties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSF bounties</a>. Because these back end servers are interchangeable, the software higher up in the stack can choose one-of-many in order to achieve its goals. They all connect to a common 'bus', which is a subnetwork on IPFS, created by the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-coord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-coord library</a>.</p><p>The JSON RPC over IPFS interface lowers costs, improves decentralization, and improves reliability.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="local-back-end">Local Back End<a class="hash-link" href="#local-back-end" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The concept of a 'local' back end is a new concept introduced in the web3 Cash Stack architecture, and it's largely encompassed by a single piece of software: <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</a>. This is the mirror image of <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-bch-wallet-service</a>.</p><p><img

width="1343" height="283" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Compared to the Global Back End, <code>ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</code> is a very 'light' piece of software. It can run comfortably on low-power computing devices, like the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pi 400</a>, with a minimal internet connection.</p><p>Eventually, <code>ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</code> will automatically find and connect to the lowest-latency wallet service it can find on the IPFS network. All communication between the two pieces of software is end-to-end encrypted.</p><p><code>ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</code> provides a convenient, local <a href="https://free-bch.fullstack.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST API interface</a> for programmers to develop against. This allows experienced Web 2.0 developers to leverage IPFS without needing to know anything about it or changing their workflow in any way. This single REST API interface is the only 'back end' software a front end developer needs to run.</p><p>An instance of <code>ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</code> is made available as a public API at <a href="https://free-bch.fullstack.cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free-bch.FullStack.cash</a>. This allows public access to the BCH blockchain for phone apps, random web apps, and the <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psf-bch-wallet</a> command line wallet.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="front-end">Front End<a class="hash-link" href="#front-end" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The <a href="/blog/web3-cashstack">Web 3 Cash Stack article</a> introduced four types of use cases:</p><ul><li>Exchanges/Companies</li><li>Casual Users</li><li>Hobby Developers</li><li>Censored Users</li></ul><p>Those four use cases are represented by the four front end software instances in the image below.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Front End Software" src="/assets/images/web3-realized-frontend-a5506098839314e4755ab59c60a541bf.png" width="1343" height="463" class="img_E7b_"></p><p><a href="https://wallet.fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallet.fullstack.cash</a> is a great example of a Web 2.0 app that an Exchange or Company might build. It follows all the Web 2.0 best practices for scaling and a good user experience. This app connects to a cloud-hosted instance of <code>ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</code> which in-turn connects to a dedicated instance of <code>ipfs-bch-wallet-service</code>. The use of IPFS in this case is superfluous to normal operation, but it does provide a way to 'fall-back' to the community infrastructure in an emergency. A form of 'failing gracefully'.</p><p>Up to this point, the <a href="https://psfoundation.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSF</a> has not offered an Android or iOS version of <a href="https://wallet.fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallet.fullstack.cash</a> because the cloud infrastructure cost is much more expensive. Freeloaders of the REST API service can be avoided in the web app, but not in the phone app. But that is no longer a significant burden with this new architecture.</p><p>The phone app represents the 'Casual User' use case. An Android APK file will be offered soon that can be side-loaded to a phone. It will connect to <a href="https://free-bch.fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free-bch.fullstack.cash</a> for it's back end infrastructure. That server will load-balance connections between community 'global back ends'. The UX and performance of the app will depend on the community that supports it, and the burden will not be born by a single individual or company.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">psf-bch-wallet</a> is a command-line wallet app for Hobby Developers. Because it does not have a graphical user interface, it's much faster and easier to prototype new ideas and compose 'exotic' transactions. This app can connect to <a href="https://free-bch.fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free-bch.fullstack.cash</a> for it's back end, but is most flexible when using a local instance of <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</a>. It has commands to control the IPFS node inside <code>ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</code>, to make it switch between different back end services. It gives the user complete control over their network connection.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/gatsby-ipfs-web-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gatsby-ipfs-web-wallet</a> will soon be getting renamed to <code>gatsby-ipfs-bch-wallet</code>. This will be our IPFS-first wallet. The concept of IPFS-first is taken from the 'mobile-first' design philosophy, which took the emphasis off of desktops and moved it to smart phones. In the same way, IPFS-first takes the emphasis off the centralized REST API over HTTP, and moves it to the decentralized JSON RPC over IPFS.</p><p>This web wallet will be loaded from Filecoin, and be accessible from any IPFS-gateway, just like this blognp. It will load an IPFS node within the browser-based app, and connect to an instance of <code>ipfs-bch-wallet-serverice</code> directly. Because the app is so self-contained within IPFS, it will be difficult if not impossible to censor. It will be slower than <a href="https://wallet.fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallet.fullstack.cash</a>, but it should provide wallet accessibility to people in repressive countries that actively try to block their citizens from accessing the blockchain. This will cator to the Censored User use case.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many interpretations</a> of <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web 3</a>, but a common thread in all of them is an emphasis on re-decentralizing the web. Web 1.0 was very decentralized. Web 2.0 was centralized. Web 3.0 will be re-decentralized.</p><p>In early 2021, I started to earnestly dig into the inner workings of <a href="https://ipfs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPFS</a>, to answer one burning question: "<em>What is the best way to decentralized back-end infrastructure?</em>"</p><p>This blog is an example of a decentralized front-end app, delivered over IPFS, hosted on the Filecoin blockchain. That's great for a blog or a publisher. But to do really sophisticated business applications requires censorship-resistant access to databases, blockchains, and other back-end infrastructure. <a href="https://bafybeicesmklvrh6a32ifzn75rar3ts3hzybojpztbtqamnuyl7r4nnsoi.ipfs.dweb.link/blog/ipfs-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPFS API</a> was my first attempt to conceptualize how to wire back-end infrastructure over IPFS. Over the last year I've developed, configured, and re-configured the code and networking behind the <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/cash-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cash Stack</a> in an attempt to find the best configuration.</p><p>This blog post summarizes my findings. It's my attempt to describe the path before me, the path I think that lies before the entire blockchain industry. Censorship is coming, and only the decentralized projects will survive. The Use Cases and software architecture in this post provide a map for projects to build a durable foundation of infrastructure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="use-cases">Use Cases<a class="hash-link" href="#use-cases" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Before discussing the <em>How</em>, let me present the <em>Why</em>. I was trained to always remember the 'User Story' or the 'Use Case'. <em>Why</em> am I building what I'm building? What problem is it trying to solve? That's what the Use Case captures. Users that want to access blockchain infrastructure can be categorized into one of the following use cases:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="casual-users">Casual Users:<a class="hash-link" href="#casual-users" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Familiar with installing a phone app or visiting a web page, but no significant technical knowledge.</li><li>Web 2.0 is the most efficient for this. Latency and connectivity issues of IPFS are not appropriate.</li><li>Not willing to pay money for service. Might be willing to sign up for an account, but would prefer not to.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="exchange-or-professional-company">Exchange or professional company:<a class="hash-link" href="#exchange-or-professional-company" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Has money to spend on infrastructure.</li><li>Needs isolated (not shared) infrastructure.</li><li>Needs high-speed, cloud-based infrastructure. Expects the speed and good UX of Web 2.0.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="hobby-developers">Hobby Developers:<a class="hash-link" href="#hobby-developers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Does not have a lot of money to spend on infrastructure.</li><li>May or may not have the ability to run their own full node and other back end infrastructure.</li><li>Important to support because this is where a lot of innovation comes from.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="censored-users">Censored Users:<a class="hash-link" href="#censored-users" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Lives in a country, or working within a company, that is actively trying to prevent them from accessing the blockchain.</li><li>This user wants to circumvent the censorship and is willing to jump through more hoops than the Casual User.</li><li>Not willing to pay money for service. Might be willing to sign up for an account, but would prefer not to.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="network-architecture">Network Architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#network-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Based on my research over the course of 2021, I will discuss different configurations of the <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/cash-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cash Stack</a>. The first configuration uses strictly Web 2.0 principles. The other configuration blends in components that involve IPFS. Which configuration is appropriate, depends on the Use Case being considered.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="web-20">Web 2.0<a class="hash-link" href="#web-20" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Below is the 'Web 2.0' version described in <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/cash-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Cash Stack post</a>. The centralized architecture is far more efficient and scalable than any 'Web 3.0' or decentralized architecture. It gave birth to the <a href="https://www.profitwell.com/recur/all/saas-business-model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saas Business Model</a>. As far as blockchain is concerned, this architecture is the most appropriate for the <em>Exchange</em> use case. If there is an Exchange (or company) willing to pay the bills, they can financially sustain the preferred user experience (UX) of the <em>Casual User</em> use case.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Web 2.0 Cash Stack" src="/assets/images/cash-stack-web-2-37ad804e08488856f37303af1e8dcc3c.png" width="383" height="554" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>The achilles heel of this model is <strong>censorship</strong>. It's fragile in the face of any censorship. There are well-established industry best practices for censoring this architecture. This architecture is not appropriate for the <em>Censored User</em> use case.</p><p>This architecture is also expensive. It's not practical to run this architecture from a home server. Cloud infrastructure is required in all but the most exceptional of cases. Cloud infrastructure has a monthly cost. Stop paying and the infrastructure disappears like smoke. <em>Hobby Developers</em> may be able to run this infrastructure at home, but they can not break out of the hobby-category without funding.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="web-30">Web 3.0<a class="hash-link" href="#web-30" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The Web 3.0 Cash Stack inserts two new blocks into the middle of the stack, which are mirror images of one another:</p><ul><li><em>IPFS Service Provider</em> - Proxies the REST API over IPFS.</li><li><em>IPFS Service Consumer</em> - Proxies IPFS communication to a 'local' REST API.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Web 3.0 Cash Stack" src="/assets/images/cash-stack-web-3-197c6e2ddebac3f38b1fcadbf61f676d.png" width="447" height="794" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>By adding these two new pieces of software, it decouples the expensive 'global' back end infrastructure, and proxies it to a much less expensive 'local' back end REST API. This has several advantages:</p><ul><li>Because IPFS automatically handles the complex networking, it's much more pragmatic to run the expensive global back end infrastructure from a home internet connection. This reduces the greatest cost of the Web 2.0 model.<br><br></li><li>By leveraging <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/circuit-relay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Circuit Relays</a>, this architecture is extremely resistant to attempts at censorship.<br><br></li><li>Because of the decoupling, the <em>local back end</em> is capable of using one-of-many instances of the <em>global back end</em>. It only needs to connect to one in order to succeed, and it can choose any instance on the network.</li></ul><p>If implemented correctly, the performance should be acceptable to the <em>Casual User</em> use case. The extra layers adds some latency, but it provides much lower cost. Weather this architecture is appropriate for the <em>Casual User</em> use case depends on the specific application, but the trade-offs may be acceptable. If there is no company to pay for web 2.0 architecture, this web 3.0 architecture may be the only financially practical way to roll out an app for <em>Casual Users</em>.</p><p>This architecture really exceeds at the <em>Hobby Developer</em> and <em>Censored User</em> use cases. It should be noted that the 'local' REST API can be embedded entirely in a web browser. This allows <em>Censored Users</em> the convenience of loading an IPFS-based web page in their browser, to achieve the ability to circumvent whatever actor is attempting to censor them.</p><p>This is the most flexible architecture for the <em>Hobby Developer</em>. Developers unfamiliar with running back end infrastructure, who want to focus primarily on front end applications, can run a single, simple app to provide the local back end. Developers more comfortable with Dev Ops and running back end infrastructure, can provide the global back end infrastructure to the rest of the community, from the comfort (and cost-savings) of their own home. The <a href="https://psfoundation.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permissionless Software Foundation</a> is offering <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bounties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bounties</a> to incentivize hobby developers to run this global back end infrastructure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="software">Software<a class="hash-link" href="#software" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The descriptions above are abstract. This section is for developers that want to know the specific software implementing the architecture. The software running the Web 2.0 architecture is documented in <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/cash-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Cash Stack post</a>. Here is the new software implementing the Web 3.0 architecture:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-bch-wallet-service</a> sits at the top of the global back end. It connects to <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bch-api</a>, or to the infrastructure at <a href="https://fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStack.cash</a>, and it proxies it over IPFS using a JSON RPC interface.<br><br></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer</a> is the mirror image of <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-bch-wallet-service</a>. They communicate over IPFS, and ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer provides local REST API endpoints for the front end to interact with.<br><br></li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ipfs-coord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-coord</a> is a core library used by both of the above software projects. This allows IPFS nodes to find one another, circumvent firewalls, stay connected, and communicate securely.<br><br></li><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimal-slp-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimal-slp-wallet</a> is a JavaScript library that provides basic Bitcoin Cash wallet functionality. It can interface with a local instance of ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer via its REST API. This library is used by <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/gatsby-theme-bch-wallet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gatsby-theme-bch-wallet</a> which you can interact with at <a href="https://wallet.fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wallet.fullstack.cash</a>.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Clean Architecture</strong> is a software design pattern created by <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'Uncle Bob'</a>. There are two main advantages to using this design pattern:</p><ul><li>It manages increasing complexity as new features and interfaces are added over time.</li><li>It provides defense against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">code rot</a> by isolating the parts that rarely change from the parts that change frequently.</li></ul><p>I ran across <a href="https://youtu.be/CnailTcJV_U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this great video</a> by Bill Sourour applying the Clean Architecture concepts to a REST API server built using node.js and the Express framework. After studying it for some time, I adapted the design patterns in that video and applied them to the <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-p2wdb-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P2WDB</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-service-provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-service-provider</a> repositories.</p><p>In this video, I expand on the Bill's original video and show how I applied Clean Architecture to my own REST API server using the Koa framework.</p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LftjSIbHzbo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></center><p>Code is split up into four groups:</p><ul><li>Entities</li><li>Use Cases</li><li>Adapters</li><li>Controllers</li></ul><p>Without knowing the patterns and reasoning behind Clean Architecture, the code will look 'weird' to most JavaScript developers. This is because Clean Architecture comes from outside the JavaScript world and some of it's core ideas (like dependency inversion) don't translate easily into JavaScript.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="file-layout">File Layout<a class="hash-link" href="#file-layout" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The code in the <code>src</code> folder of this repository is split up into four main directories: <code>entities</code>, <code>use-cases</code>, <code>adapaters</code>, and <code>controllers</code>. These directories reflect the arrangement of concerns in the Clean Architecture diagram:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Clean Architecture Diagram" src="/assets/images/cleanarchitecture-26ac5f08c770e19c35a8ef38b905373f.jpg" width="772" height="567" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>The above diagram is reflected in the code. The Controllers and Adapters both make up the green circle. I distinguish between the two:</p><ul><li>Controllers are <em>inputs</em> that cause the app to react.</li><li>Adapters are <em>outputs</em> that the app manipulates, like a database.</li></ul><p>The diagram below shows how dependencies are arranged in the P2WDB project:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dependency Graph" src="/assets/images/p2wdb-clean-architecture-ef2c5b41aece44bbab83375e3d0e59ae.png" width="1403" height="1263" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>Major features of the diagram above:</p><ul><li>The blunt point of an arrow connects the file that depends on the file pointed to by the pointy end of the arrow.</li><li>The dependencies in the above diagram follow the dependency arrows in the Clean Architecture diagram.</li><li>This project is a Koa web server app. Koa is a framework and the entry point of Koa program loads the Controllers first.</li><li>The Controllers load the Adapters, then it loads the Use Cases, then finally the Entities. Each lower stage depends on the stage above it.</li><li>Dependency Injection is used heavily to pass dependencies to the individual libraries.</li><li>Encapsulation pattern is used for unit tests.</li></ul><p>Moving forward, I plan to use this design pattern in all my code. I spent a couple weeks refactoring the <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-service-provider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ipfs-service-provider</a> to match these patterns and achieve 100% unit test coverage. That repository is intended to be a <em>boilerplate</em> for create decentralized, censorship-resistant providers of web services. I encourage all JavaScript developers to study this pattern and fork my code for their own use.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a fictional story about Bob and some software he set out to create. Bob is a libertarian. He loves gun culture and responsible gun ownership. He likes to drink unpasteurized milk. He's also a bachelor and would like to strike up a romantic relationship with someone in his local area.</p><p>Bob used to love the site <a href="https://craigslist.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Craigslist.org</a>. He used to be able to trade guns, buy unpasturized milk, and peruse personal ads, but now he can’t do any of those things, because Craigslist removed them in order to comply with laws and veiled threats from the State. Bob would like to build a site just like Craigslist, but one that leverages decentralized technology, so that it doesn’t have any single point of failure for the State to shut down.</p><p>Bob is a competent software developer, but building a decentralized replacement to Craigslist is going to be a big undertaking. He doesn’t know how big, but feels pretty confident that he’s going to need help. He realizes he’s going to need to find other people like him. He needs to form a community that cares about the same thing he cares about.</p><p>Bob discovers the <a href="https://psfoundation.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permissionless Software Foundation</a>, the PSF token, and the token-liquidity app that pegs the PSF token to BCH. He creates his own SLP token. Since he’s making a project for decentralized ads, he calls it the DAD token for Decentralized ADs.</p><p>Bob saw the crazy growth around <a href="https://spicetoken.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Spice token</a> and other tipping tokens. He thinks that having a tipping token would be a great way to grow a community around his software idea. But he wants his token to have <strong>some</strong> kind of financial value, so that people take it seriously. He’s also fond of the PSF community and wants his token and community to be attached to this larger, like-minded community.</p><p>Bob decides to fork the token-liquidity app and use it to peg his DAD token to the PSF token with it. He’s talked to several members of the PSF that want to support his idea. They are willing to collectively stake $1,000 worth of PSF tokens to help him launch his idea. Armed with a seed fund of PSF tokens and a fork of the token-liquidity app, he adjusts the equations so that the initial value of his DAD token is $0.01 per token.</p><p>Bob is really happy with this setup. His token has a low price and low transaction fees, which makes it work great as a tipping token. It’s also loosely pegged to the PSF token, which means his project is financially connected to the bigger PSF community and even bigger cryptocurrency community. But the peg is pretty loose, so Bob and any other contributors have the potential to realize a lot of upside if their project is successful.</p><p>Bob goes about coding up his idea. He spends weeks working on it and gets a clunky proof-of-concept app up. He shows it off to the PSF community and talks about it to other cryptocurrency developers whenever he gets the chance.</p><p>Through these efforts, Alice learns about Bob’s project. She has her own reasons for wanting a decentralized clone of Craigslist, and starts contributing code to the DAD project, which benefits her own goals with the software. Bob is really happy to get high-quality code contributions from Alice. He tips her in the DAD token every time he merges a pull request. There is no formal agreement. Alice isn’t contributing code with the expectation of being paid. Bob is just tipping whatever he feels is appropriate, based on his own perceived value and what he thinks the project can afford.</p><p>Time goes on. Because of the partnership between the DAD project and PSF, the communities grow together. More developers like Alice join the project. Eventually the project improves the software to a point where it has a steady stream of users. Whenever a user places an advertisement on the platform, they pay some BCH, which goes to burn DAD tokens.</p><p>Bob runs his own site using the DAD technology, focusing on guns, unpasturized milk, and personal ads in his own state. Alice runs her own site using DAD technology, which focuses on trading cryptocurrencies. Other people run their own web apps leveraging the DAD technology, but they all have the DAD project in common.</p><p>The price of the DAD token starts to increase. At some point Bob starts to worry about the amount of money behind the token, and is concerned that he’s the only person holding the minting baton for making more DAD tokens. He reaches out to the PSF for help. The PSF helps him move the minting baton to a multisignature wallet, so that minting new tokens requires agreement of three-of-five of the top contributors to the DAD project. They also set up a multisignature ‘war-chest’ wallet to protect excess funds, so that all of the DAD project funds are not only in their token-liquidity app.</p><p>Bob feels a lot better. He’s found a way to share responsibility and liability with other top contributors that he’s built trust with. If the State decides to pick on Bob, or he needs to leave the project, the DAD project and its funds are safe.</p><p>More time goes on. Bob needs to step away from the project for personal reasons. He’s still happy to participate in the community, but he needs to significantly reduce the amount of time he spends on the project. Alice is still making great commits to the project, and agrees to take on the title of ‘maintainer’. The title isn’t too important because all funds are protected by multisignature wallets. If Alice ever needs to step away from the project too, she can easily pass on the ‘maintainer’ title to the next best contributor.</p><p>There is a steady stream of new improvements to the project, but certain areas are lacking, like dev-ops, unit tests, and documentation. These areas of work are tedious, and not nearly as fun as developing new features. Alice and Bob agree to focus their time on creating bounties to shore up the areas of the project that need more attention. They create tightly-scope code-bounties with the intention of generating small, easily-reviewable pull requests. Each bounty is tagged with a reward of DAD tokens. Alice and Bob share responsibility for creating new code-bounties and doing code reviews. They agree that whoever takes on the management and merging of a bounty gets 20% of the bounty in DAD tokens, to make it worth their time.</p><p>More time goes by. The individual contributions of Alice and Bob are less and less important to the DAD project as a whole. They've each realized significant upside from their contributions, and can take pride in making the world a better place. The DAD project takes on a life of its own. It has it’s own management of top-contributors, who direct the DAD token to balance intrinsic contributions to the code base with extrinsically motivated work on automated testing, reliability, and documentation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the Open Source software community, it's become common to collectively refer to a code repository, the developers working with the code, and the users consuming that code as a 'Project'. A 'Project' is not any one of those things in isolation, but the collection of them together. The Node.js Project. The Linux Project. The Mocha testing framework. The Babel transpiler. These are all examples of open source projects.</p><p>A Foundation, like the <a href="https://openjsf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenJS Foundation</a> or <a href="https://www.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache Foundation</a>, collect and steward Projects. This is the same role that the PSF has been playing.</p><p>A Product, without any reference to open source, is pretty widely understood. It belongs to a company and there is branding and other business considerations attached to it. Understanding the intersection of a Product and an open source Project is a puzzle that has fascinated and dogged me for years. Is there a bright line separating the concepts or do they amorphously bleed into one another? What is the 'proper' way to balance these ideas or blend them together?</p><p><a href="/blog/what-is-psf">My last blog post</a> started to explore this idea in earnest. I've started to mentally unwrap the tangle of concepts that make up the <a href="https://psfoundation.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSF</a>, <a href="https://fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStack.cash</a>, and other ideas community members of the PSF have about the organization. <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Building_a_Business_on_Open_Source_Ebook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Business on Open Source</a> greatly clarified my thinking around these topics. I've continued to have conversations with PSF members and experienced thought-leaders like <a href="https://vimeo.com/52639930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikeal Rogers</a>.</p><p>This blog post captures some of my latest ideas on Open Source Products vs Projects, and how these ideas relate to the <a href="https://psfoundation.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Permissionless Software Foundation</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="characteristics">Characteristics<a class="hash-link" href="#characteristics" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Over the course of continuously asking myself the question 'What makes up a Product vs Project?', I collected characteristics that distinguish one concept from the other. This comparison and contrast has helped me grasp the nature of the relationship between the two concepts:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Products:</strong></p><ul><li>Die when the company behind them dies.</li><li>Can have a brand built around them.</li><li>May have a scope, but that scope is less important than product-market fit and pivoting to meet user needs.</li><li>When a product needs specialized knowledge to take the next step in its evolution, money and people go into action to fill those gaps.</li><li>Products are primarily developed through Extrinsic motivation.</li><li>A product focuses on serving specific end-user needs.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Projects:</strong></p><ul><li>Never die. They simply go into hibernation until a new maintainer picks them back up or forks the project.</li><li>Branding is confusing and does not work very well, because there is no hard accountability (like a product has).</li><li>Has a clearly defined scope.</li><li>When a project needs specialized knowledge, it suffers until/unless someone with the right knowledge starts to participate.</li><li>Projects are primarily developed through Intrinsic motivation.</li><li>A project focuses on serving broad-based industry/infrastructure needs.</li></ul></li></ul><p><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Building_a_Business_on_Open_Source_Ebook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Business on Open Source</a> explains how to setup a healthy, symbiotic relationship between Projects and Products:</p><ul><li>Companies build Products (downstream) and regularly pull down updates from the Project (upstream).</li><li>They also feed improvements back upstream to the Project, through Pull Requests and patches.</li></ul><p>Through that relationship, both parties are better off. Since they are playing two distinct roles, the relationship is win-win and there is no conflict of interest.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="configuring-relationships">Configuring Relationships<a class="hash-link" href="#configuring-relationships" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Recent discussions I've had with PSF membership and industry advisors have inspired me to draw out some diagrams of what these relationships between a Project and a Product could look like. I use the PSF as an example here, but these ideas are only intended to foster discussion. They are not a proposal for the future.</p><p>The lens through which I'm viewing a lot of these lessons around Product vs Projects is the relationship between the PSF, FullStack.cash, and private companies that will join the community. Like the Linux Foundation, the PSF is intended to be made up of a consortium of complimentary businesses. Some ideas on the table for other complimentary businesses are:</p><ul><li>A 'Code School' to help developers gain cryptocurrency experience and achieve standardized certifications.</li><li>An engineering-for-hire company that could help to match developers and entrepreneurs, and then manage the resulting projects.</li><li>A non-profit organization for custodying keys and managing the token liquidity app. A sort of 'firewall' between the PSF community and any required legal compliance.</li></ul><p>Underpinning all these organizations is the PSF, which focuses on its custodianship and maintenance of code, code which all these organizations depend on. If the businesses behind a Product can be analogized as a building, the PSF would be the slab of concrete they are all built on top of.

The <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/towards-a-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSF Core software</a> would be considered the primary project under the stewardship of the PSF, but also, only <em>one</em> of the projects under its care.<br><br></p></li><li><p>In this view, <a href="https://fullstack.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FullStack.cash</a> is a business with an open source <em>Product</em>, which exchanges code with the PSF Core Project as described in <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/Building_a_Business_on_Open_Source_Ebook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Business on Open Source</a>. FullStack.cash services external clients and receives payment for that service. This means FullStack.cash would be a for-profit company and its current model of burning PSF tokens would need to change. More on that later.<br><br></p></li><li><p>A Non-profit corporation for working with tokens would be created, and it would have a closed-loop relationship with the PSF. This organization would focus on <em>custody</em> of keys for minting batons and <em>managing</em> token-focused software like the token-liquidity app and cross-chain token bridges. They would mint and distribute tokens according to the direction of the PSF. It's primary reason for existence is to <em>attempt</em> to be compliant with laws around token creation and management. (At this point in history, I believe actual compliance is impossible due to opaque guidance and over-reaching jurisdictional enforcement, but I'm no lawyer, and this entity could exist to navigate those waters as best as it can.)<br><br></p></li><li><p>An engineering-for-hire company could be formed to cater to the ever-present market demand for talented cryptocurrency developers. Importantly, this companies fate would not be tied to the PSF. It's success or failure would not necessarily reflect on the PSF or its projects, though there would be a steady flow of communication around code. There could also be many engineering-for-hire companies associated with the PSF.<br><br></p></li><li><p>Another clear market need that should be serviced is a 'code school' that can help serious cryptocurrency developers distinguish themselves against the background noise of scams and hype. Such a business, with a close relationship to the PSF, could generate great branding. It would have a natural symbiotic relationship with the PSF and the engineering-for-hire companies. There are various business models around coding bootcamps that could be applied to this organization, and fit nicely given a relationship with the engineering-for-hire company.</p></li></ul><p>The diagram of relationships resembles a constellation of Products revolving around the PSF at its center. The relationships between Products is loosely coupled, but they all share the gravity of the PSF in common.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="token-economics">Token Economics<a class="hash-link" href="#token-economics" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The above architecture of relationships have an impact on the token economics of the PSF. Each company and Product has a dependency on a Project stewarded by the PSF, and they are not required to have a direct relationship with the PSF token. Instead, their relationship switches to a model similar to the Linux Foundation: the companies relationship with the token would be purely for supplying financial support to the PSF (donations) and to influence the governance of the Project (by gaining the right speak in <a href="https://t.me/psf_vip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the VIP room</a>).</p><p>This means that the Products in the diagram are not included in the circular economy depicted below. That's a bit of a sacred cow for me, as that idea of a circular economy was largely the inspiration for the creation of the PSF. But perhaps its time for that sacred cow to evolve.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A Virtuous, Circular Token Economy" src="/assets/images/circular-token-economy-a304a679e3d3e4d8409e757d22a905b1.png" width="715" height="512" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>I still believe that a self-funding, circular economy using tokens is still possible. Where:</p><ul><li>Developers maintaining software are rewarded in tokens.</li><li>Usage of software burns tokens, making the tokens held by developers more valuable.</li><li>Continuous improvement drives increased usage of the software. This improvement comes from two sources:<ul><li>Intrinsically motivated development will add new features that spur growth.</li><li>Extrinsically motivated development will prevent code-rot and increase reliability.</li></ul></li></ul><p>This idea is not necessarily something that the PSF needs to stop focusing on. The PSF as a Foundation can still develop code like the <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-p2wdb-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay-to-write database</a> project, which is perfectly aligned with the above diagram.</p><p>This is an important nuance in the scope of the work done by PSF. I imagine the community will need to be careful about how it categorizes the code under its stewardship. It will need to view each code repository through the lens of the token economy:</p><ul><li>Much of the software that is used commercially, and does not fit the closed-loop token economy, will expect donations to power the development and maintain the software.</li><li>The few software repositories that <em>do</em> fit well withing the closed-loop economy model, can self-fund the extrinsically motivated work to improve their code.</li></ul><p><em>Maintenance</em> and <em>reliability</em> are two valuable considerations for any software project. Any desire to improve these metrics require funds to pay for necessary extrinsic motivation, as intrinsic motivation is hard to come by for these two areas. <em>Documentation</em> is often another area where intrinsic motivation is ineffective too.</p><p>The closed-loop framework provides a self-funding mechanism for bootstrapping a project from purely intrinsic activity, to generate funds for the necessary extrinsic motivation. If this model is not viable, then donations is the only viable funding mechanism that I can see.</p><p>If I'm right in this conclusion, it will be critically important to categorize and segregate the software repositories based on how they fit within the close-loop token economy. Am I right in drawing that conclusion? That's the discussion I'm looking to have.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://psfoundation.cash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The PSF</a> has been a passion project of mine for almost three years, though it's really hard to pick a 'start' date. It's been an ongoing experiment to try and solve a puzzle. The name of the puzzle is: How do you sustainably fund the development and maintenance of open source infrastructure?</p><p>I really like the PSF's quarterly funding model, because it gives us a chance to look back every three months and assess what worked and what didn't. It does not allow bad ideas to fester for too long, and each quarter provides more data to drive decisions toward the 'good' (whatever that may happen to be).</p><p>It is this quarterly reflection that inspired this blog post. This is my opportunity to sit down, look at what's working and what's not. It's an opportunity to continue to ask the question, 'What is the PSF?'. An opportunity for me to try to articulate my thoughts so that I can share it with the rest of the community, so that we can collectively discover the 'good'.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="open-source-is-a-journey">Open Source is a Journey<a class="hash-link" href="#open-source-is-a-journey" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I've been creating and participating in open source communities for 20 years. It's been a journey of deeper and deeper understanding. Many people have been on this journey with me, and I've managed to collect a few gems of knowledge along the way. The PSF largely represents my attempt to apply these lessons to the creation of open source infrastructure for scaleable cryptocurrency.</p><p>Some thought leaders I follow closely in this space are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/mikeal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikeal Rogers</a> who started the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs-certified-developer-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js Foundation</a> and wrote <a href="https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthy Open Source</a>, both of which inspired the <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/healthy-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSF governance model</a>.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/nayafia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nadia Eghbal</a> who wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbHerX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Working in Public</a>, a seminal book on managing open source projects.</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/JWhitehurst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jim Whitehurst</a> who wrote <a href="https://amzn.to/2TpvR2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Open Organization</a>, and was the CEO of Red Hat Linux.</li><li>John Mark Walker is a writer on open source topics that I've started following recently. I was deeply inspired by his essay <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-best-practices/building-a-business-on-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Business on Open Source</a>.</li></ul><p>The rest of this article is going to stitch together some of the lessons I've learned from the above thought leaders, and how they apply to the PSF. Basically, this article is going to be a condensed version of the articles and books linked above, and how I think they apply to the PSF.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="crypto-is-open-source">Crypto IS Open Source<a class="hash-link" href="#crypto-is-open-source" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Many developers in the cryptocurrency space reject the notion that there are lessons for the cryptocurrency industry to learn from the open source software industry. Their logic is that cryptocurrency is 'money' and somehow that separates it from open source software.

width="518" height="491" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>The above Venn Diagram is how I conceptualize the relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and the open source software industry. Crytocurrency <strong>is</strong> open source software. In fact, it's just a tiny segment of the much larger open source industry. <em>Every</em> lesson gained from the open source industry can be applied to cryptocurency. Some cryptocurrency projects are <em>also</em> trying to be money, and that extra feature may be one of the keys to unlocking sustainable funding of open source infrastructure.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="a-liberal-contribution-policy">A Liberal Contribution Policy<a class="hash-link" href="#a-liberal-contribution-policy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>It's a toss-up as to which open source community has had more impact on my life: Bitcoin or Node.js. While Bitcoin is characterized by the rampant toxicity and infighting of its community, Node.js is characterized by its effectiveness at producing quality, industrial software and managing a large, diverse community of developers. The <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/healthy-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js governance structure</a> was employed by Mikeal to grow the contributor base from 3 to over 300 active developers. The vast majority of whom are unpaid and voluntarily dedicate their time to the project.</p><p>Working for Bitcoin.com, on the software that eventually became the <a href="https://psfoundation.cash/blog/towards-a-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSF Core software</a>, was my first experience getting <em>paid</em> to work on open source code. Prior to that, I had written lots of open source code and contributed to open source projects, I had just never been paid. I also had a ton of experience participating in open source communities before that job.</p><p>One of the first, disappointing realizations that I had while working there was that Bitcoin.com was clearly building an open source <em>product</em> and not an open source <em>project</em>. Furthermore, I realized that company management had no conceptual understanding of the important (but nuanced) difference between the two. They were releasing the code as open source, but they were strictly gate-keeping the code that went into it. They had some vague notions about monetization, but had no clear path to either profit or sustainable maintenance of the code base.</p><p>Unfortunately, I carried forward this bad habit of gate-keeping additions to the code. But over the last year I've really internalized the idea of the <em>liberal contribution policy</em> described in <a href="https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/healthy-open-source-967fa8be7951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthy Open Source</a>. The JavaScript community, and the Node.js project in particular, is famous for their radically open policies to code, which are optimized to lower the barriers for new contributors to participate in a software community. The crux of the idea is that code submissions should <em>land by default</em>, instead of the opposite which is to block them until they can be carefully code-reviewed (which is the norm in a company).</p><p>I'd been struggling to conceptualize a development workflow that would allow for a liberal contribution policy while still maintaining high quality production-ready code for FullStack.cash.</p><p>The solution I had come up with was to create a separate GitHub group for FullStack.cash production software, where I could maintain tight control over the code for 'my' organization. The code in the FullStack group would be forked from the PSF group. So FullStack would be considered the 'downstream', and PSF would be considered the 'upstream'. The 'upstream' repository would have a liberal contribution policy, while the 'downstream' repository would maintain tight QA control and production-ready code.</p><p>I was vindicated recently when reading <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-best-practices/building-a-business-on-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Business on Open Source</a>, where he recommended exactly this strategy for differentiating an open source <em>product</em> from an open source <em>project</em>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="a-circular-economy">A Circular Economy<a class="hash-link" href="#a-circular-economy" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When I first conceptualized the PSF and what sustainably funded infrastructure would look like, I had the image below in mind: a simple, virtuous, circular economy where usage would drive value of the token and innovation in the software:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A Virtuous, Circular Token Economy" src="/assets/images/circular-token-economy-a304a679e3d3e4d8409e757d22a905b1.png" width="715" height="512" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>This idea was echoed by Galia Benartzi when <a href="https://youtu.be/LcbHTF3zCdI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">describing community currency research</a> that lead to the Bancor project. And the idea was further enhanced by Nadia Eghbal in <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbHerX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Working in Public</a>, where she does a deep dive into intrinsic (passion) vs extrinsic (money) motivation when applied to open source developers.</p><p>This is why I'm so passionate about the <a href="https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-p2wdb-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pay-to-write database project</a> (P2WDB). It follows the simple incentive model illustrated above.</p><p>But the P2WDB project is in its infancy, and the road up to this point has been very bumpy. While much of the PSF software is geared to follow the above model, adoption has failed to grow as fast as I had hoped, and the PSF is still far away from a point where extrinsically motivated developers can take over the maintenance of the projects from the intrinsically motivated developers (such as myself).</p><p>While an open source <em>project</em> can live for years with no overhead costs, propelled by a few intrinsically motivated developers, an open source <em>product</em> lives and dies based on the company driving it. And anything that can kill the company, such as liability or insolvency, can also kill the product.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="build-a-business">Build a Business?<a class="hash-link" href="#build-a-business" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The PSF is muddling the lines between being a company, a foundation, and a community. I've gotten rather comfortable with our ambiguous state, and embrace our non-legal existence. But it's extremely confusing for everyone else, and that confusion is disencentivizing businesses from joining our consortium. It's also impacting our effectiveness as an organization, as there is little consensus around the answer to the question: 'What is the PSF?'.</p><p>Supporters and founders of the PSF have suggested we create a 'front facing' company to be the PSFs representative in the fiat world. It could accept fiat donations and be a 'real' legal entity. It could legitimately hire developers. It could be a respectable organization, with branding and intellectual property. The potential to bring in money could help the organization <em>grow</em>. After all, who doesn't want to see rapid growth?!</p><p>It would also need a steady income ...presumably from donations? That means it can also run out of money and go bankrupt. It could also be sued ...but maybe that's a good thing, as it could shield the people associated with the organization?</p><p>One conceptualization of the PSF would be as a research and development organization. Our token economic model could help businesses share the cost of research and development by pooling resources. I like this idea on its surface, but I'm hesitant to be the focal point for a legal organization that I don't understand and am not fully aligned with.</p><p>There is an argument to be made that PSF could gain donations easier if it had a front-facing representative, which could more easily incentivize businesses to join the consortium. There is also a lot of money available if PSF can tap into the sea of money behind engineering-for-hire services.</p><p>None of that is bad, but it is rather distracting from the original goal I set out to achieve: being the change I want to see in the world, by collaborating with other developers to write good code and improve the software infrastructure in this space. For me, everything beyond that is a detail or a distraction.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="fullstackcash">FullStack.cash<a class="hash-link" href="#fullstackcash" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I honestly don't know where PSF ends and FullStack.cash begins. I don't know how to explain the relationship between the two.

width="563" height="353" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>FullStack.cash renders infrastructure services to clients. But the PSF sends out invoices to those clients, and clients pay PSF directly. The PSF then reimburses FullStack.cash for cost of goods sold (in tokens). This ensures that any profit goes to burn tokens, which is in line with the circular economy I've been trying to achieve. But tax liability is rather dubious as 'profit' (and the tax burden of such) rests on an entity that legally doesn't exist and does not reside in any physical jurisdiction.</p><p>The branding and segregation between an open source <em>product</em> (FullStack.cash) and a <em>project</em> (PSF), as described in <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-best-practices/building-a-business-on-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building a Business on Open Source</a> is an attractive model to follow, but that would change the nature of the flow of revenue. Right now FullStack.cash is burning nearly 100% of the PSF tokens each month. How do we avoid a conflict of interest between FullStack.cash and PSF? What would the token-burning model look like if FullStack.cash was isolated as its own separate entity?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="token-flow">Token Flow<a class="hash-link" href="#token-flow" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Finally there is token-flow. Below is a chart of the 'Net Token' flow over the last year. Dots above the zero-line means the PSF token increased the amount of BCH backing it. Dots below means the amount of BCH backing the token decreased. Said another way: above the line is good, below the line is bad. The 9-month trend-line is showing growth, but the last few months have been pretty flat, with small gains that could easily be wiped out.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Net Token Flow of the PSF Token" src="/assets/images/net-tokens-4cb1ff02f2eac4f811a7b7952afcc642.png" width="849" height="493" class="img_E7b_"></p><p>It begs the question, what is actually driving the flow of tokens? From most impact to least, here is the best I can figure:</p><ul><li>Speculation - This is bad. The math behind the token-liquidity app is supposed to disencentivize this, but outcomes have not matched expectations. This is causing price volatility and adding noise to the data.</li><li>Development donations - This is good. We've had some interested parties buy tokens to sponsor software development. But this also causes volatility, and dubious long term benefits to the token price. PSF members have been discussing a new model around NFTs to solve this problem.</li><li>FullStack.cash SaaS burns tokens every month. This is the best.</li><li>Fans - This is good. PSF does have some fans that are willing to own enough tokens to gain access to the VIP room and keep tabs on the inner circle. This is good, but small.</li><li>Payments to developers come in two types:<ul><li>Core software development pays out tokens, but brings in no income, so this decreases the price of the token. Sort of a necessary evil, and should be minimized.</li><li>Developers being hired and paid in PSF tokens. This has mostly net-zero effect on the token price, but is slightly beneficial.</li></ul></li></ul><p>With the exception of speculation, none of the items above are bad, but their relative impact is not matching my expectations. Ideally, SaaS burns would be the greatest driver with the most impact, and speculation would have the least impact. Payments to developers require a lot of overhead and management, and has a very small net effect on the token price, which is disappointing.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="playing-games">Playing Games<a class="hash-link" href="#playing-games" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>From a game-theoretic standpoint, it seems to me that the PSF is playing two distictly different games:</p><ul><li>One is a fiat-pegged game. Money comes in, money goes out, based on work done.</li><li>One is a token-based game with no consideration of fiat. It involves:<ul><li>Inconsistent, intrinsically motivated work primarily,</li><li>Complimented by a little extrinsically motivated work, incentivized by a closed-loop token economy.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The rules of the first game are based on fiat, and are the ones most people are comfortable playing. It's just a business, and it plays by the same rules all businesses play by. Money comes in, money goes out. There are taxes, and legal liability, and intellectual property to worry about. There is overhead and accounting, management, hiring, and all the other things that businesses do when playing the 'let's stay in business' game.</p><p>The second game is all about burning tokens. There is the token, the reserve asset, and the floating peg between the two. Trying to tie the game to fiat is confusing, and as I'm discovering, detrimental to winning the game. The key to winning this game is to maintain a balanced budget, and growth is proportional to the amount of tokens burned. It's a slow slog.</p><p>One of the most interesting things to me about the second game is that it's native to cryptocurrency. It does not rely on or need to touch fiat. It does not need to be a legal entity or exist in any physical location. It embodies all the best qualities of decentralization.</p><p>The first game is much more comfortable because it's conventional (older and better understood). The second game is unconventional, and not fully baked yet. The first game can be accelerated through outside investment or donations, the second game can be accelerated through increasing the number of intrinsically motivated developers, collaborating slowly, whenever their passion and time allow.</p><p>As an organization, we're slowly losing both games. Everyone involved, including myself, is attracted to the conventional game because its comfortable and has the potential for rapid growth. But the unconventional game is simpler, and applies directly to the goals I set out to achieve. If played correctly, either game (or both?) could result in sustainable funding of development.</p><p>Where we go from here is not up to me. Many look to me as a leader, but I'm making a consistent effort to point out that I don't have all the answers. I recognize that I can not succeed on my own.</p><p>Success means achieving sustainable funding of open source infrastructure.
